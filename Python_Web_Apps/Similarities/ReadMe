This is a web application written using Python with Flask and Jinja.

The application accepts two strings as input, and calculates the number
of steps required to change one string to the other.  The steps are add,
remove, and substitute.

Base code was provided before-hand. My role in this project was to program the following:

-Implement the 'distances' function in 'helpers.py'
-Implement 'index.html' 
-Implement 'matrix.html', 

This project was done as part of Harvard's CS50 course through EdX.
