Pointers seem to be a very difficult topic for some reason.
I know it took me a while to be able to wrap my head around
the concept.

A big challenge for me was the abstraction.  I think it is easy
to get lost in the concept of a pointer indirectly 'pointing' 
to data through an additional (and seemingly unnecessary to a
new programmer) variable.  

The code snippet in pointer.c shows the relationship between
arrays and pointers.  When the concept was explained to me
like this (possibly more than once...), it made a lot more sense.

The syntax is easy to jumble as well, especially if you are a newer 
programmer.  It can take a while to nail down with confidence
whether you should use '*' '&' '[]' or something else in a given
scenario.

As with many things in programming, and life in general, 'practice
makes permanent'.  I think that simply dedicating time to practicing
pointers (correctly) will lead to a better understanding.

On a philosophical note, a 'challenging' concept like this drives
me crazy sometimes as I am trying to learn it, but it is so so very
satisfying when I finally get it down.  It is one of my favorite 
things about computer programming - there is no shortage of topics
to feed my brain.

If everything were super easy, wouldn't life be kind of boring?
