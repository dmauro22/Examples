This program provides an example of how a series of JPEG
files could be recovered from a memory card that has been
'erased'.  It is part of the projects assigned in Harvard's
CS50 course.

When a memory card is erased, it doesn't always get wiped
completely.  Sometimes images can be recovered if you know
where to find them.  JPEGs have a distinct header.

The input here is a .raw format, in the manner that you
might find on a digital camera's memory card.  The program
outputs numbered JPEGs if they can be recovered.
