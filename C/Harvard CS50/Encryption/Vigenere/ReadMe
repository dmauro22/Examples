A program that accepts a string (used as a cipher key)
from the command line as an argument after the program name.
Once the program is running, the user is prompted for
another string, which will be encrypted. This second
string is encrypted according to the key and returned to
the terminal output.

This cipher is slightly more elaborate than the Caeser cipher,
but is not recommended for encrypting anything important.
