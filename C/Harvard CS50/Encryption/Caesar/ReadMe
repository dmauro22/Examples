A program that shows a very simple method of encryption.
It is not secure, and is not recommended for anything
other than introducing how encrpytion works.

The program requires an integer as an argument from the 
command line immediately after the program name and before
pressing enter.  

Once the program is running, the user is prompted for a 
string.  This string is then encrypted according to the 
user-provided key and is returned to the terminal output.
