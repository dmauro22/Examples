This program is a simplistic representation of a brute force password cracking algorithm

The key assumptions:

-We have access to usernames and hashed passwords
-The passwords have been encrypted with C's DES based crypt function
-The program call includes one command line argument: the hashed password 
-This hashed password should be 13 characters total: a 2 character salt followed by the encrypted password
-The password is a maximum of 5 characters (I did say that it was simplistic)
