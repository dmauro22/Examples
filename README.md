Examples of code

Various programs that I have written using C, C++, Python, SQL, etc

The C++ applications are largely desktop based object oriented programming

The C applications include bitmap resizing program, a JPEG recovery program,
and a few password cracking/encryption programs

The Python applications include a couple of dynamic web applications, 
the highlight being 'Finance', a full stack stock trading simulator
