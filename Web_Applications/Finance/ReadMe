This is a stock trading simulator that I am currently working on.  
It was created as a project for Harvard's CS50 course.

The main application is implemented using Python with HTML and CSS
A SQLite database is used to track the users, portfolio, and trading history
Flask is used for the webserver
Jinja is used for templating the HTML pages
